    "slug": "analog-mission-mcc-voice-loops",
    "summary": "Modelled after the voice loop structure used in the Columbus Control Centre and in flight control centres around the world, this software allows users to listen in to up to three voice loops simultaneously. Volume can be adjusted on each loop, and they can each be toggled while speaking. Certain loops have restricted permissions to comply with operational procedures - for example, all flight controllers can listen into the Space to Ground loop, but only the CapCom, Flight Director, and astronauts in the base can speak in this loop. This new software both improved realism to match industry standards and simplified Asclepios MCC communications. Additionally, the MCC communications software implemented an artificial six-second round-trip communications delay to simulate the latency in communications between the Moon and the Earth. While this has been done previously in NASA or ESA-led analogue projects such as NEEMO and PANGAEA-X/Analog-1, Asclepios is the first non-space-agency analogue mission to implement it.",

    "summary": "Magnetohydrodynamic Vortex‑Inducing Photobioreactor Experiment (MVIPER) tests a novel way to mix and de‑gas algal photobioreactors in weightlessness. Instead of pumps and membranes, it uses a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drive: electrodes impose an electric field through a conductive growth medium while permanent magnets supply a perpendicular magnetic field. The resulting Lorentz force spins the liquid into a vortex that should drive liquid outward and force gas bubbles inward for easy separation, potentially making future life‑support bioreactors simpler, lighter, and more reliable in space. The experiment was tested during the 87ᵗʰ ESA–Novespace parabolic‑flight campaign in September 2025. The GUI fuses 15 sensor channels telemetry, FLIR video, and live g-level classification into a single dashboard used on the A310 Novespace Zero-G aircraft.",
